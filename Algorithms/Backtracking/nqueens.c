/*
N-Queens problem is to place n - queens in such a manner on an n x n chessboard that no queens attack each other by being in the same row, column or diagonal.
This problem is to find an arrangement of N queens on a chess board, such that no queen can attack any other queens on the board.
The chess queens can attack in any direction as horizontal, vertical, horizontal and diagonal way.
A binary matrix is used to display the positions of N Queens, where no queens can attack other queens.

Algorithm
1) Start in the leftmost column
2) If all queens are placed
    return true
3) Try all rows in the current column. 
   Do following for every tried row.
    a) If the queen can be placed safely in this row 
       then mark this [row, column] as part of the 
       solution and recursively check if placing
       queen here leads to a solution.
    b) If placing the queen in [row, column] leads to
       a solution then return true.
    c) If placing queen doesn't lead to a solution then
       unmark this [row, column] (Backtrack) and go to 
       step (a) to try other rows.
4) If all rows have been tried and nothing worked,
   return false to trigger backtracking.


E.g.,   Given a 4x4 chessboard and no. of rows & columns of the chess-board 1 through 4.
        We have o place 4 queens, such as q1, q2, q3, q4 on the chess-board don't attack each other.
        
	chess-board given   { 0, 0, 0, 0 }
						{ 0, 0, 0, 0 }
						{ 0, 0, 0, 0 }
						{ 0, 0, 0, 0 }

    solution of the     { 0, 1, 0, 0 }
    board               { 0, 0, 0, 1 }
						{ 1, 0, 0, 0 }
						{ 0, 0, 1, 0 }
