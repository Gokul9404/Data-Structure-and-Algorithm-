--BackTracking--
BackTracking is an algorithm technique solving problem recursively by tring to build a solution incremenrtal one peice at a time, 
removing those solutions that fails to satisfy the constraints of problem at any point of time

Ther are three type of problem in backtracking:-
    -> Decision problem
    -> Optimization probelm
    -> Enumeration problem

Most common example of BackTracking is sukdoku solver.
