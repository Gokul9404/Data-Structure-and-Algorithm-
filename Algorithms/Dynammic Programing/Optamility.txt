--Principle of optamility--
A problem is said to be satisfy the Principle of optamility if the sub-solutions
of and optimal solution of the problem are themselves the optimal solution for their sub-solution.


-Optimal Binary Search Tree-
The frequency and key-value determine the overall cost of searching a node. The cost of searching is a very important factor in various applications.
The overall cost of searching a node should be less. The time required to search a node in BST is more than the balanced binary search tree as a
balanced binary search tree contains a lesser number of levels than the BST. There is one way that can reduce the cost of a binary search tree is 
known as an optimal binary search tree.
