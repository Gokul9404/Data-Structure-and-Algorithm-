What is a graph?
A graph is an ordered pai of a set V of vertices and a set E of edges
    G = (V, E)
    |V| => number of vertices
    |E| => number of edges

What is edge?
A connection between two noddes is called edge.
There are two types of edges:
    Directed edge   :- A connection from one node to another,but uni-directional.
                       A graph having only Directed edge is called Directed graph or Di-graph.

    Undirected edge :- A connection b/w nodes that is bi-directional.
                       A graph having Undirected edge is called Undirected graph.
-------------------------------------------------
::EDGES::
Weighted and Unweighted edges:-
Weighted edges are edges having different weight or value on-themselves.
Unweighted edges are edges having same weight on-themselves.

self-loop   :- An edge having same origin and end point.

Multi-edges :- Connection b/w one node to another node by mutiple-edge, it can be either Directed or Undirected edges

::No of Edges in a Simple-Graph::
::For Directed Graph:-
    V = {v1, v2, v3, v4}
    |V| => 4 or n
    here, no. of edges will :: 0 <= |E| <= 4*(4-1) or n(n-1)[for Directed graph]

::For Undirected Graph:-
    V = {v1, v2, v3, v4}
    |V| => 4 or n
    here, no. of edges will :: 0 <= |E| <= (4*(4-1))/2 or (n*(n-1)/2) [for undirected graph]
    E = { {v1,v2}, {v1,v3}, {v1,v4}, {v2,v3}, {v2,v4}, {v3,v4} }

:::SPECIAL NOTE:::
If no of edges are close to maximum no of edges possible, then it is called Dense
If no of edges are close to minimum no of edges possible, then it is called Sparse

-------------------------------------------------
::Path in a Graph or Walk:-
A sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge

:Simple Path:-
A path / Walk in which no vertices and edges are not repeated.

:Trail:-
A walk in which no edges are repeated, vertices can be repeated.

:Closed walk:-
A walk that starts and ends at the same vertex is called closed walk.

:Simple-Cycle:-
A closes walk in which only start and end vertices can repeat.(Or other than start and end vertices no other vertices can repeats.) 

::Length of a Walk/path ==> No of edges that are in the Path/Walk. (It's length is always greater than 0.)

-------------------------------------------------
:::Graph Connection:::

::Strongly Connected Graph:-
If there is path from any vertex to any other vertex.

::Connected:-
If there is path in the graph, to go from any vertex to any other vertex.

::Weakly Connected:-
If a directed graph can to turned into connected graph if we treate each edge as undirected, then this type of graph is called Weakly Connected.
