:: Minimim Spanning Tree ::
A minimum spanning tree can be defined as the spanning tree in which 
the sum of the weights of the edge is minimum.
The weight of the spanning tree is the sum of the weights given to the edges of the spanning tree. 


:: There are two methods are converting a Graph into a Minimum Spanning Tree::
    -> Prim's Algorithm
    -> Kruskal's Algorithm
----------------------------------------------------------------------
:: PRIM'S ALGORITHM ::
Prim's algorithm to find minimum cost spanning tree (as Kruskal's algorithm) uses the greedy approach.
Prim's algorithm shares a similarity with the shortest path first algorithms.

Prim's algorithm, in contrast with Kruskal's algorithm, treats the nodes as a single tree 
and keeps on adding new nodes to the spanning tree from the given graph

Working of Prim's algo:-
1) remove all loops and parallel edges
2) Choose an arbitrary node as root node
3) Check al outgoinf edges and d=select the one with the least weight
----------------------------------------------------------------------
:: KRUSKAL'S ALGORITHM ::
Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum cost spanning tree uses the greedy approach.
This algorithm treats the graph as a forest and every node it has as an individual tree.
A tree connects to another only and only if, it has the least cost among all available options and does not violate MST properties.

Working of Kruskal's algo:-
1) Remove all loops and parallel edges.
2) Arrange all edges in their increasing order of weight.
3) Add the edges which has the least weightage.
